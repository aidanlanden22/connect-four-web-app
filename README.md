# Stateless Connect Four

## Play Connect Four with your friends online!

Stateless Connect Four is a lightweight web application designed for quick and effortless games played over the web, hosted at [connectfour.xyz](https://connectfour.xyz)!

The user's web client connects to a simple websocket server. The backend does not store any game state, instead state is passed back and forth between players over the websocket connection. This ensures a lighting quick and highly scalable web application. In the case of a player disconnecting, game state is stored in browser cookies and players are automatically reconnected upon navigating back to the game link.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Usage

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
